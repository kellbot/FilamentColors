# Filament Goblin
A tool to help you avoid buying filament that's similar to what you already have

This extension provides a sidebar in google chrome and inserts a few extra buttons on FilamentColors.XYZ. 
You can use the new buttons to collect filaments, then view your collection while browsing other websites.

If you have filaments which are not on FilamentColors.XYZ you can also stub them in and provide a swatch color.
